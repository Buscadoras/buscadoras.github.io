<h4>About the project</h4>

<div class="pink">
<p><strong>No Están Solas: Bridging the Search for the Disappeared in Mexico</strong>, , aims to create a bilingual portal offering a set of pedagogical and informative tools on the collective response to disappearances in Mexico and the search work of collectives, family members, and searchers. It will function as a productive, practical, and easily accessible space for the socialization of information, intercommunication, critical analysis, and the construction of collective memory. Through the production of capsules with collectives and family members and the articulation of data and information, this project will facilitate dialogue between those unfamiliar and those who have acquired extensive experience and have become familiar with the reality of disappearance across borders. Finally, we want to respond to a pressing need for cross-border coordination between organizations, knowledge-generating institutions, and searchers.</p>

<p><strong>This project is made possible by a 2021-2022 "Magic Grant" from the Brown Institute, a collaboration between Columbia and Stanford Universities, support from the Center for the Study of Mexico and Central America, and the Columbia University Library.</strong></p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The idea for the Project stems from the creation of the Buscadoras Research Unit (BRU), created in the fall of 2020 by Professor Claudio Lomnitz along with graduate students Greg Odum and Monica Trigos and Professor Monica Castillejos of the University of California-Berkeley School of Law. The BRU is a team of student and faculty volunteers, organized with the goal of supporting missing persons organizations operating in Mexico and Central America today. The BRU dedicated its efforts to developing mutually productive research in collaboration with a Mexican collective of family members of missing and disappeared persons, "Regresando a Casa Morelos", by offering their time, skills, and perspectives to assist with a variety of research and educational needs. BRU, along with the Center for Mexican Studies, organized a comprehensive 3-day conference with solidarity organizations, family collectives, researchers, and journalists to share their diverse projects on this issue and to strengthen collaborative networks and increase public interest.</p>
